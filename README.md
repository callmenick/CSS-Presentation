# CSS Novice to Ninja by Nick Salloum

In this repo you'll find a PDF'd version of my presentation - CSS Novice to Ninja.

The demos are all for exploratory purposes, and if you have any questions, feel free ask me.

Be sure to check out the full demo as well, where I got into a nice responsive layout with grids, and some image overlays with CSS transitions.
