# CSS Presentation by Nick Salloum

Hey all, in this repo you'll find a PDF'd version of my CSS presentation I gave a few weeks ago. I hope it helps with your projects.

The demos are all for exploratory purposes, and if you have any questions, feel free to come and ask me.

Be sure to check out the full demo as well, where I got into a nice responsive layout with grids, and some image overlays with CSS transitions.
